# StackGnosis

StackGnosis is a full-stack web application that uses Django for the backend with a responsive React frontend.
It operates as an organically expanding wiki-like knowledge base for technical concepts and software products.

This was an early foray into using React as a frontend and also some practice with django-channels, Redis, and websockets.
